# GetOrganized

A digital closet where you can add, view, edit your clothes and its details.
A calendar where you can plan your daily look, get reminded about what to wear on what day.
After you organize your items, buy what you really need, and sell what you don’t want, so we have.
Some customized shop recommendations based on the items you have added to your digital closet.
A forum to post your clothes and buy other’s second-hand items.
The app also shows you the total number of your items, and keep track of your spendings on your clothes.
And we have two language versions, in English and Chinese.
